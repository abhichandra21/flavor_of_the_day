# Flavor of the Day Integration Quality TODO

This document outlines required actions to ensure the integration meets top-notch quality standards before deployment to Home Assistant.

## Investigation Summary

### Current State ✅
- Integration follows modern HA architecture patterns (runtime_data, type safety, async/await)
- Comprehensive test suite exists with proper mocking
- Virtual environment setup works correctly
- Code structure follows HA conventions
- Multiple providers implemented (Culver's, Kopp's, Oscar's, Leduc's)

### Issues Identified ⚠️

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Deployment)

### 1. **Provider Functionality - Culver's Not Working**
**Priority: CRITICAL**
- **Issue**: Culver's provider returns 0 locations when searching for Madison, WI
- **Root Cause**: Web scraping approach may be outdated - Culver's website structure likely changed
- **Impact**: Primary provider completely non-functional
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Investigate current Culver's website structure
  - [ ] Update scraping selectors/API endpoints
  - [ ] Test with multiple locations (Madison WI, Chicago IL, Milwaukee WI)
  - [ ] Verify __NEXT_DATA__ parsing approach still works
  - [ ] Consider fallback to alternative data sources

### 2. **Code Quality - 367 Linting Errors**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Significant linting violations preventing clean code deployment
- **Categories**:
  - Relative imports (TID252): 12+ violations
  - Test assertions (S101): 20+ violations
  - Exception handling (BLE001, G202): Multiple violations
  - Code style (ARG002, TRY300): Various violations
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Fix all TID252 relative import issues
  - [ ] Address exception handling violations
  - [ ] Clean up test assertion patterns
  - [ ] Remove unused method arguments
  - [ ] Run `./scripts/lint` and fix all issues

### 3. **Testing Infrastructure Issues**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Test dependencies cause version conflicts during installation
- **Symptom**: Extremely long pip resolution times, dependency conflicts
- **Impact**: Difficult development experience, CI/CD reliability concerns
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Simplify requirements.txt - separate dev/test dependencies
  - [ ] Create requirements-dev.txt for development dependencies
  - [ ] Pin compatible versions to avoid conflicts
  - [ ] Test installation on fresh environment

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. **Security & Hardcoded Values**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Validation script reports "Potential hardcoded secret in sensor.py"
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Investigate and remove any hardcoded secrets
  - [ ] Audit all files for API keys, tokens, or sensitive data
  - [ ] Ensure all config values come from config flow

### 5. **Home Assistant Compliance**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Several deviations from HA standards identified in development guide
- **Specific Issues**:
  - Device class usage (SensorDeviceClass.ENUM vs TEXT)
  - Missing comprehensive logging
  - Entity category considerations
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Review and fix device class usage in sensor.py
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout
  - [ ] Consider EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC for utility sensors
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling in all components

### 6. **Provider Reliability**
**Priority: HIGH**
- **Issue**: Need to verify at least one provider works reliably
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Test all 4 providers (Culver's, Kopp's, Oscar's, Leduc's)
  - [ ] Ensure at least 2 providers are functional
  - [ ] Document which providers are confirmed working
  - [ ] Add integration tests for working providers

## MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 7. **Documentation Completeness**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Missing Documentation**:
  - [ ] Installation instructions for HACS
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - [ ] Developer contribution guidelines
  - [ ] API documentation for providers
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Complete README.md with setup instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section
  - [ ] Document provider addition process

### 8. **Testing Coverage**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Issue**: Need integration tests beyond unit tests
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Add end-to-end integration tests
  - [ ] Test config flow with real data
  - [ ] Test sensor updates with live data
  - [ ] Add provider-specific integration tests

### 9. **Error Handling & User Experience**
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Improvements Needed**:
  - [ ] Better error messages for users
  - [ ] Graceful degradation when providers fail
  - [ ] Rate limiting feedback
  - [ ] Connection timeout handling
- **Action Required**:
  - [ ] Review all user-facing error messages
  - [ ] Add helpful troubleshooting hints
  - [ ] Test error scenarios

## LOW PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 10. **Performance Optimization**
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] Review request timeout values
- [ ] Optimize web scraping efficiency
- [ ] Add caching for location data
- [ ] Minimize API calls

### 11. **Feature Enhancements**
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] Support for upcoming flavors (if available from providers)
- [ ] Multiple location support
- [ ] Custom update intervals per sensor
- [ ] Flavor change notifications

## DEPLOYMENT READINESS CHECKLIST

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: At least Culver's provider working (0 locations found currently)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: All 367 linting errors fixed
- [ ] **HIGH**: No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] **HIGH**: Clean test dependency installation
- [ ] **HIGH**: Home Assistant compliance verified

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Provider Testing**: Manual testing of 2+ working providers
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Full config flow testing
- [ ] **Local Testing**: `./scripts/develop` works without errors
- [ ] **CI/CD Testing**: All tests pass in clean environment

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] README.md updated with accurate setup instructions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide completed
- [ ] Provider support status documented

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

1. **FIX CULVER'S PROVIDER** - Investigate why location search returns 0 results
2. **RESOLVE LINTING ERRORS** - Run `./scripts/lint` and fix all 367 errors
3. **VERIFY PROVIDER FUNCTIONALITY** - Test all providers, ensure 2+ work
4. **CLEAN DEPENDENCIES** - Simplify requirements.txt to avoid conflicts
5. **SECURITY AUDIT** - Remove any hardcoded secrets
6. **INTEGRATION TESTING** - Verify end-to-end functionality

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Integration
- [ ] At least 2 providers functional (including Culver's)
- [ ] Zero linting errors
- [ ] Clean installation process
- [ ] Basic integration testing passes
- [ ] No security issues

### Production Ready
- [ ] All providers tested and documented
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Full documentation
- [ ] Integration tests covering edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimized

## NOTES

### Provider Investigation
- Culver's website may have changed since implementation
- Consider using network inspection to identify current API endpoints
- May need to update User-Agent strings or headers
- __NEXT_DATA__ approach may still be valid but needs verification

### Testing Environment
- Virtual environment creation works correctly
- Home Assistant 2025.2.4 installs successfully
- Issue appears to be with pytest and dependency resolution
- Consider using uv or pip-tools for better dependency management

### Code Quality
- Core architecture is sound and follows HA patterns
- Most issues are stylistic/linting rather than fundamental
- Exception handling could be more specific
- Import structure needs cleanup but is functional
